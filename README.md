### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I use C++/Qt, C# and a PHP.<br>
I like create stuff with arduino or related to "smart house". Or just something fun, like spectrum analyzer.<br>
I use PHP only as part of something that is not related to web-development. For example, 2FA system in one of my apps. <br>
Mainly i use C#. <br>
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on <s>app, that helps in learning programming languages.</s> nothing
