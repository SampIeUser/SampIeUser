### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I use C# and a PHP.<br>
I like create stuff with <s>arduino</s> ESP32, like things related to "smart home" or just something fun, like spectrum analyzer.<br>
I use PHP only as part of something that is not related to web-site development, just for easy backend setup for my projects, for example 2FA system in one of my apps. <br>
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on <s>app, that helps in learning programming languages.</s> <br>
- Minecraft java server plugins. not for public release
- Random C# stuff
